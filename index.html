    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>Mother Teresa (1910-1997) was a Roman Catholic nun from the Republic of Macedonia who adopted India as her country of service. 
        She dedicated her life in the service of the poor, ailing and the destitute through the Missionaries of Charities, an order of Roman Catholic nuns, in Kolkata, India. 
        She had once said, “Love cannot remain by itself – it has no meaning. Love has to be put into action, and that action is service.” 
        Her work transcended geo-political borders and she encompassed the whole of humanity in her healing embrace. 
        Her work was recognised through numerous international and national awards and recognitions. 
        She was canonised at a ceremony in St. Peter’s Square at the Vatican by Pope Francis on September 4, 2016 and came to be known as Saint Teresa of Calcutta.</p>
